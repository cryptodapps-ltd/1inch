Private keys and recovery phrases are the essential credentials that define ownership in self-custody wallets.

In self-custody, the biggest risk isn’t always volatility — it’s losing access to funds. There’s no bank to call and no password reset. Control of wallet access rests with the holder and depends on two things: the **private key** and the **recovery phrase**. These are the credentials for importing or migrating a wallet across devices and the recovery method if access is lost.

By contrast, in centralized finance (CeFi), private keys are held by custodians such as exchanges. Users don’t manage them directly, which makes access easier but also means they rely on the security and policies of the provider.  

This article focuses on **self-custody**, where private keys and recovery phrases are in the user’s hands.

## 🔒 What Are Private Keys?

A wallet doesn’t literally “store” coins. Instead, it acts as a tool for interacting with the blockchain, where all balances and transactions are permanently recorded. Access to those funds relies on a pair of cryptographic keys:

- **Public key** → Generated from the private key; creates the public address that others use when sending funds.  
- **Private key** → A confidential cryptographic string that proves control over funds and is used to sign transactions associated with a wallet address.  

When a transaction is made, the wallet prepares it locally (amount, fee, destination/contract, and any required data). After confirmation, the wallet uses the private key to sign the transaction and then broadcasts it to the network. Nodes verify the signature with the public key and, if valid, include it in a block.  

⚠️ Without the private key, a transaction cannot be signed or accepted.

## 📝 What Is a Recovery Phrase?

To make private keys easier to manage, wallets generate a **recovery phrase** (also known as a seed or mnemonic).  

- It’s a set of 12, 18, or 24 random words generated by the wallet.  
- It can recreate all derived private keys in compatible wallets or devices.  
- It acts as both an **access credential** and a **backup**.  

This phrase allows a wallet to be imported into another compatible app or device and serves as the fallback to restore access if the original app is removed, the device is lost, or hardware stops working.  

⚠️ Because the recovery phrase is the blueprint for all private keys, it must be protected with the same level of caution. Whoever obtains it controls the wallet.

## ✅ Best Practices for Keeping Them Safe

- 🚫 **Never share** your private key or recovery phrase. No legitimate service will ask for them.  
- 📜 **Use offline storage** → Write it down on paper or use a hardware medium instead of storing it on an internet-connected device.  
- 📸 **Avoid screenshots** → Digital backups can be hacked if devices or accounts are compromised.  
- 📦 **Create multiple backups** → Store in safe, separate locations to protect against theft, fire, or damage.  
- 🔐 **Use secure wallet backups** → For example, 1inch Wallet offers encrypted cloud storage (Google Drive for Android, iCloud Snapshots for iOS) and file backups. Neither 1inch nor the storage providers can read your encrypted data.

## 🌍 Why They Matter

Private keys and recovery phrases aren’t just technical details — they **define ownership in crypto**. They give individuals full control of their assets without intermediaries, but they also bring full responsibility.  

👉 Once lost, they **cannot** be reset or restored. Safeguarding them is therefore the most important practice for anyone using crypto wallets.
